					<p class="mb-4">The process of issuing student IDs in DTU takes a long time, three weeks on average. The student cards offer access in the buildings and cantine discounts (40%), therefore students need the cards as soon as possible.</p>
					<p>Therefore, the purpose of the project is to investigate the work and service system of DTU student IDs production and delivery and offering redesign solutions for the discovered problems.</p>

					<h3>Discover phase</h3>
					<p class="mb-5">In order to define the problem and to map out the current process we did <b>interviews</b> with relevant stakeholders and a <b>survey</b> for the international students.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<h4>Interviews</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>The first two interviews were with two workers (Trent and Keegan) of the <b>International and Administration Offices of DTU </b>that had knowledge about the involved parts of the system. Using the gathered information, about the physical part of the system, we created the Stakeholder Overview and a first draft of the Swimlane Diagram. We obtained the contacts of other key stakeholders involved in the system. Keegan suggested that they think about buying a capable printer in order to do printing inside DTU.</p>
							<p><strong>We decided to focus on the international students because the Danish ones receive their cards at home before the school year starts.</strong></p>
						</li>
						<div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto mb-4">
							<img src="images/workAndServiceSystemDesign/stakeholderOverview.svg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
						</div>
						<li>
							<p>Next interview was with two (Ian and Bo) of the responsible people for the <b>IT and security services of DTU</b>. The obtained information was regarding how the process is perceived from the IT point of view, what is currently done, how the student card system works from an IT point of view and what is doable from their expertise. We found out that they can print some of the cards internally, but they don’t have the resources to print all the cards. They also strongly suggested buying a capable printer in order to do printing inside DTU.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Next interview was with Victoria from another <b>university in Copenhagen (CBS)</b>. CBS an inhouse printing system with printers from Sagio, so we wanted to find out if this solution is worth pursuing. She explained the process in detail:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									In peak periods -semester start- they have 28 student workers working in shifts from 08:00 – 18:00 for around 2 weeks approving pictures and printing cards among other tasks
								</li>
								<li>They have 3 printers of approx. 55.000dkk/printer that have a lifespan of +/-5 years. The printers need a software licence with a price of 50.000dkk/month.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>We decided to avoid this solution becasue it involves too many resources and we can suggest a better redesign.</strong></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Last interview was with Camilla from another <b>university in Copenhagen, KU</b>, where the cards are also printed by Sagio. We found out that Sagio’s process takes 3-5 days, therefore this <strong>helped us take Sagio out of the scope of the project.</strong></p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<h4>Survey</h4>
					<p>The survey had 53 responses and targeted international students. It was used to validate the problem and explore other existing problems.</p>
					<div class="col-lg-9 mx-auto mb-4">
						<img src="images/workAndServiceSystemDesign/survey.svg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
					</div>
					<p>The most common problems (aside from waiting time) the students found were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Knowing whether your card is in progress (66.7% of responses)</li>
						<li>Communication from DTU about uploading a picture (47.5% of responses)</li>
						<li>Knowing whether your picture was approved (36.1% of responses)</li>
						<li>Finding the link to upload the picture (25% of responses)</li>
						<li>Using the upload picture page from DTUBasen.dtu.dk to upload the picture (22.2% of responses)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12 section-title">
					<h3>Define phase</h3>
					<p>The process is very complicated and confusing, therefore we used multiple methods to map it down. </p>
					<p class="mb-5">We started with the <b>SIPOC diagram</b> in order to gain an overview of inputs and outputs in the system and who supplies what to whom during the card creation process.</p>
					<div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto mb-4">
						<img src="images/workAndServiceSystemDesign/sipoc.svg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
					</div>

					<p><b>The snapshot</b> was a good way to gain an overview of all the different stakeholders and the different artefacts in the system, such as information and products.</p>

						<img src="images/workAndServiceSystemDesign/snapshot.svg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>Based on the survey responses and the discussions with some students, we created a persona and her <b>customer journey</b> in relation to the system.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The wait time is a big problem for the customer</li>
						<li>The interactions and touchpoints are mainly digital.</li>
						<li>The students may have many questions throughout the process.</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto mb-4">
						<img src="images/workAndServiceSystemDesign/customerJourneyMap.svg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>In order to understand the relationships between the different organisational units and the processes that each of these units perform we mapped the <b>organisational ergonomics</b> within the current situation.</p>
					<div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto mb-4">
						<img src="images/workAndServiceSystemDesign/organisationalErgonomics.svg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>Providing students with cards requires several manual steps to follow. To visualize and comprehend each of this activities, a <b>hierarchical task analysis</b> has been mapped. The detected issues are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
						Each card arrives with a letter, and they need to be matched together and put into envelopes which leads to excessive work.</li>
						<li>Manually typing student numbers and sending emails creates mistakes.</li>
						<li>No efficient ordering and storage method.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>The swimlane diagram</b> is the one that mapps the process taking into consideration the order od the activity and the stakeholder that does it. It is the final and most illustrative method we used. </p>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>
						<b>The cognitive ergonomics</b> were considered for the interface where the students upload their picture. It was done by looking at the screens from a UX point of view.
					</p>
					<p>Main points were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>upload button is hard to spot</li>
						<li>there is a lot of text</li>
						<li>the need to crop image is not obvious</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Test with users:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>4 out of 4 did not see the upload button at first</li>
						<li>0 out of 4 read all of the text</li>
						<li>3 out 4 did not understand that they had to crop</li>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<p>Next, we did a small <b>affinity diagram</b> to collect all the issues and points from our field work and analysis. This resulted in the problem focus with three different categories: lack of information, workspace ergonomics and student ergonomics. This diagram helped in identifying the breakdowns of the system.

					<h3>Develop & Deliver phases</h3>
					<p>We <b>brainstormed</b> possible redesign solutions focusing on one breakdown at a time. Each solution was analysed and we chose to offer short term redesign solutions because the system needs immediate improvement and long term ones which will be much more efficient. The some of the diagrams were redone to illustrate the redesignes system and to prove that a lot of the unnecesary steps were removed.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<h4>Breakdown 1</h4>
					<p><b>Short term solution:</b> The International Office incorporates a section with personnel responsible of approving pictures. During peak periods (semester start) it consists on their main task. A list of responsible persons (which can be consulted by Administra- tion Office) is created with the responsible names, assigned pictures to approve and contact details.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<h4>Breakdowns 2&3</h4>
					<p>Make the picture upload a mandatory part of the application for international students and provide information of the card status in the same page where the picture is uploaded.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<h4>Breakdown 4</h4>
					<p>Redesign the webpage where the student should upload the picture. The main improvements are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Make the upload button more visible with color and centering it</li>
						<li>Include progress bar (solution from breakdown 3)</li>
						<li>visualize picture requirements</li>
						<li>Show cropping immediately</li>

					<h4>The Swimlane Diagram of the Redesigned System</h4>
					<p> Only 3 parties responsible for the process due to simplification and giving international office more responsibilities (authorization to check and approve/disapprove the pictures).</p>
					<p>There are less activities due to simplification and clarification throughout the process (clarification if picture is accepted or not and mentioned what needs to be improved if not accepted also link to check status is directly available and in- formation is shared through inside).</p>
					<p>The amount of manual tasks is reduced (such as folding the letters and entering the mail addresses in the system).</p>

					<h4>Testing</h4>
					<p> We performed <b>qualitative testing</b> with 4 students for the redesigned webpage for uploading the picture:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All said the new version was much easier</li>
						<li>Liked the visible upload button, progress bar and that cropping was made obvious</li>
						<li>Were generally quicker with new version</li>
					</ul>
					<p> We performed <b>quantitative testing</b> with 12 students for the redesigned webpage for uploading the picture. We computed the average time to complete the task:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Current system: 27 seconds</li>
						<li>Redesigned system: 12 seconds</li>
					</ul>

			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<h4>Long Term Solution</h4>
					<p>The long term solution we suggested, besides using software to analyse and approve the pictures, is digitalising the student IDs. A mobile application is the best choice, as most of DTU's students have mobile phones and carry them around all the time. There will still be the option to have the physical card for the ones that want it, but there will be a fee for it.</p>
					<p><b>Why did we suggest this?</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>The solution is a sustainable option compared to the physical cards.</li>
						<li>It would save DTU a lot of financial and human resources, because all the steps with printing, delivery, distributing would be removed from the system.</li>
						<li>Physical cards can be easily misplaced or the RFID chip can be broken.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The mockup follows DTU's design guidelines.</p>
